The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization that took place during the late 1700s and early 1800s. It began in Great Britain and soon spread to other parts of the world. This revolution marked a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way.

Key developments included the use of steam power, the rise of factories, and mass production techniques. Inventions such as the spinning jenny, the steam engine, and the power loom transformed industries like textiles and transportation.

Urbanization increased as people moved to cities in search of work, leading to significant social and economic changes. While the Industrial Revolution brought about technological progress and increased productivity, it also led to harsh working conditions, child labor, and environmental degradation.

Ultimately, the Industrial Revolution laid the foundation for the modern industrial economy and changed the course of history by ushering in an era of rapid innovation and global economic growth.
